# Programming Elm
This repository of code is from following the examples in Programming Elm. It is a great book and recommend a read if you are interested in Elm. I did not follow all the code instructions as I am still at the basics stage with Elm.

# elm-files
This small Elm application was the first demonstration of Elm from the book which was not in the Elm REPL. It demonstrates the Elm data types: String, Int, Float, Bool. It showcased this by displaying text within the browser.
